Therefore, we must reflect on the construction of knowledge, because in order to draw social lines we must take into account the constant movement of these images on a global sale. @globalECH
Appadurai talks about the new role of globalization for the imagination of social life, since within the global processes multiple images of the world are generated.
Ethnotourism is an example of how the practices and knowledge of indigenous communities acquire an agency and a new representation when they enter the market. @globalECH https://t.co/M2bNERi0w3 v√≠a @eldefinido
Mitchell's text speaks of how there is a commercialization of gay identity politics. This since the use of the economic incentive obtained through sex tourism in Brazil is in order to promote the recognition of the gay community and its social inclusion from the market @globalECH
The combination of Latin rhythms with the wave of house is a sample of how traditional sounds are incorporated and participate in the global culture through a reconstruction of the national aesthetic. #globalizationECH https://t.co/1mxjblVGas
@globalECH
Indonesian indie pop reflects the transformation of the local in terms of their participation in a global culture. A way to deterritorialize the local as something proper to a nation state through transnational aesthetics that allows them to supplant national structures.
@globalECH
This article shows what Appadurai said about the formation of life worlds that are expressed througt common subjetivities. It is about the case of  young Syrian forced migrants as they attempt to rebuild their lives in three host countries: Lebanon, Greece and the United Kingdom. https://t.co/17xn9Nzpxw
The diaporic flow and the transnationalization of communication leads us to rethink how the locality is produced, since it is no longer only a way of belonging to a territory, but also contexts of spatial, social and technical alterity. #globalizationECH
The minga is an example of how the search for collective and individual rights of a community that is recognized from different regulations based on self-government is expressed. A type of citizenship based on ethnic criteria #globalizationECH https://t.co/9IxjwrVdq3
@globalECH
The transnational flow has generated a depletion of the formal sense of citizenship, while there are new dynamics of belonging. Thus, not only do we have to be from a specific territory, but we also understand cultural, ethnic ideas, among others, to signify belonging to a space.
@globalECH
Telecommunications have modified the ways of interacting in society. In social networks we experience how cultural processes fluctuate in multiple directions, dimensions and rhythms simultaneously. Globalization interconnects temporal landscapes such as the case of marches. https://t.co/wk2DfvPbyM
People through their particular environments experience global processes, since cities have become central nodes in which transnational trade networks converge that articulate the local and the foreign. #globalizationECH
This is an example of how entities such as the IMF become transnational apparatuses of governability that, through new policies or programs of structural adjustment, reconfigure the capacity of states to spatialize their authority #globalizationECH https://t.co/hbejKMgV96
@globalECH
The state has demarcated a spatiality through daily practices that fall into instances of control. Mechanisms that based on economic policy and security apparatuses shape the local communities in a precarious way. However, all under the idea of a joint construction of state.
This is an example of how migrants affect political configuration processes, which are marked by their interests, customs and traditions, transcending borders to respond to a need. #globalizationECH https://t.co/WNbyMCXGk6
Globalization has become a phenomenon that diminishes the idea of borders. Thus, transnational immigrants can be understood as the response to the total incorporation of the nations in which a process of deterritorialization takes place. #globalizationECH
Thinking about a globalized world can be the way to fracture the forms of territorialization but is it possible to think of a global citizen without roots to a nation or culture as the basis of identity? #globalizationECH https://t.co/yrj7VIeGUX
Conceiving the world as a spatial partition has fractured history, while confining us to the idea of a world order in which individuals must be rooted in a specific place and culture. #globalizationECH
Although MSF seeks to avoid national and international bureaucracies, its activity can be seen as a transnational entity and a migrant sovereignty that under a temporary administration sets a precedent in the face of inadequate governments #globalizationECH
This report shows how humanitarian action can exercise a political exercise and denounce the crisis facing southern Sudan. The position that, as Redfield points out, can be denoted as a minimalist biopolitics in the name of human rights. #globalizationECH https://t.co/LwZucMwHQl
I recommend this article because it allows to see how in a fictitious context of Africa the development policies could be applied and the possible consequences that it would have for 2030. #globalizationECH https://t.co/JUb6Fmcp5M
The insertion of food projects in the Colombian countryside, in the name of development, is aligned with the idea of the expansion of bureaucratic power, since more than improving agricultural production there was an appropriation and domination of the peasantry #globalizationECH
This article is important because it allows us to see the history of colonialism not only through a dominant discourse but it is fundamental to take up other testimonies in order to understand their consequences in current history. #globalizationECH https://t.co/B1aaWxjBdV
My recommendations are @Forbes, @wef, and @EconSociology #globalizationECH
The problem of globalization is cause of economic reforms, which are mediated by a narrow ideology of entities such as the IMF or WTO, who are interested in ignoring the aspects of sequence and rhythm when promoting liberalization of the capital or privatization #globalizationECH
My recommendations are @museumofbc, @Diversehistory2 and @refugee_archive  #globalizationECH
To think of globalization as a current process is to deny the contact between countries that has existed since the 15th century. The idea of modernity as a product of globalization should be understood as a standardized economic and political narrative. #globalizationECH
My recommendation are  @MigrationUK, @NadineElEnany and @AmericanAnthro #globalizationECH
Studies have framed society in isolated categories and relationships without a social or economic context as a basis for its understanding, which has resulted in "false models of reality" that adapt to ideals and fragmented facts #globalizationECH
