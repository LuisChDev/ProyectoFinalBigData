@protosemite this is a really really good thread thank you-Bolivian anthropology twitter just had a small but intense beef btwn a cool professor and a grad student being incredibly pedantic that a particular term was authentic and not borrowed from quechua (fwiw, it is, but so what)
@porchsides @triflinghomo oh you're right I forgot about the inexplicable injuries
@porchsides @triflinghomo isn't them taking their clothes off actually a relatively common thing people do when they're freezing to death?
@just_here_4evan you're right it sucked

@thepinna cancelling my covid test rn and going to the grocery store for some onions
what are some good intro to trotskyism books? for research purposes only lol bc it was historically the dominant marxist trend in the bolivian labor movement
@thepinna how is that even related to whether or not you have covid
@parsonshanged F feel better soon!
@just_here_4evan you're making points
@just_here_4evan king this is your first bad opinion

@hnnhsm god i wish
@just_here_4evan i want to listen to your tum 🥺
slept through sunday did i miss anything?
@ionasmom handsome elder
@pcrul1 i still don't understand what it is
this also generated a lot of rural-urban migration, creating a new and mostly informal periurban proletariat and a rural underclass of poor farmers who own very small amounts of land
where am i going with this? the way that land ownership/access/distribution policies change has major implications for indigenous sovereignty and autonomy and also for political economy--for instance, the mass expansion of monocrop plantation agribusiness as export commodities
in a similar way, i think that juan velasco's "revolutionary" military coup in peru in 1969 still merits attention, particularly because it too implemented a radical land form and collectivized agriculture. it failed miserably and the peasants ultimately dismantled it themselves
i think the 1952 national revolution in bolivia deserves a lot more new/closer study than it gets- an uprising of workers and peasants beat the army and carried the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement's coup over the finish line, forced them to implement a radical land reform
@cas_mat_ disappointing but somehow unsurprising
@ionasmom so handsome
@protosemite ..do it and you're cool
yearning for someone to h*ld my h*nd
@thepinna obi toppin is #1 to me for his name alone
@aliengender i don't rn but it's on libgen!
@pcrul1 honestly bc he deserved a glow up https://t.co/9pM01EkmeS
@aliengender you might like the book "mosquito empires: ecology and war in the greater caribbean" by j.r. mcneil, i read it for a class last year and it's fascinating history of how mosquitoes and mosquito borne diseases actually made history themselves
@pcrul1 yeah
if i can regain the ability to put the words in my head into word documents it's over for academia
@whorganik they're probably good but i haven't yet tried any :/
@whorganik they make and sell their own hummus it's pretty good
@parsonshanged dynamite is high on the list of tactics we should be learning from the Bolivian union movement tbh
@reallylameacc i think about this a lot
@dadfrn capitalist innovation is why social media is all the same now

@DevinAHaas well how different would it be?
@evanjosephs but you could never kiss a tory boy without wanting to cut off your tongue again
@qu0hog yeah like sometimes I'll just assume they didn't see it and resend the original too
@cas_mat_ @hyporeality oh yeah i forgot self goes through a lot of the marx-engels reader right? power reads a lot of capital vol one
@cas_mat_ @hyporeality power, they'll read more marx and get kropotkin exposure. also anyone who can take power and come out of it still a liberal is a lost cause
@hyporeality correct. make them take remedial sosc until they understand what words mean
RT @hyporeality: @anthropolitburo if ur an adult who went to u chicago and you still throw around the word human nature like it’s a thing y…
RT @qu0hog: @anthropolitburo you say you’re a capitalist and yet you let me have one of your fries without asking for anything in return...…
@qu0hog maximizing my utility means whatever i want it to mean. many people misunderstand this simple point
the logical conclusion of the intrinsic selfishness arguments is that humans spent like a hundred thousand years twiddling our thumbs and creating nothing until capitalism fell out of the sky
"people are inherently selfish" shut the fuck up and prove it! I'll save you some time too: you can't, the entire ethnographic and historical record says ur full of shit and that's probably why ur tryna debunk materialism with fake idealism
every time a uchicago student makes anticommunist arguments based on their idea of some really existing universal human nature i die just little bit more inside
@OceanOfIvy @dadfrn yeah! fraternal, my sister goes to n*rthwestern
@dadfrn can confirm
RT @NeeedlesEye: I'm a simple man I see a post pointing out political science is fake I retweet it
sources: "el katarismo" by Javier Hurtado (1986), "microgobiernos barriales" by Pablo Mamani Ramírez (2020), and "batallas por la identidad" by Carlos Macusaya (2019)
in any case, it's become a hegemonic symbol on the Bolivian left and has spread from Bolivian indigenous movements to be used as by indigenous organizations in other andean countries. 5/5
this makes sense because the faction which managed to seize the state was the far right Santa Cruz oligarchy (ie, Camacho). it also means that the resistance to the coup goes a lot deeper than just people's feelings about Morales. 4/x
this is in part why the burning of the wiphala after the coup was so important: it wasn't just a rejection of the MAS or even of Evo himself but rather of indigenous peoples' historical struggle against systemic racism and colonialism 3/x
one of the first groups to popularize it was an early indianista organization, the MINK'A, which was founded in 1970. around this period Aymara and Quechua youth started attending universities, where they quickly began a process of recovering + politicizing their history 2/x
the wiphala has popped up a lot on twitter of the last year because of what's been going on in Bolivia, but it wasn't actually created or even originally popularized by the MAS. although they did exist pre-conquest, the wiphala as used today dates to the late 1960s 1/x https://t.co/31NETqFBRh

@shroudofthesea i struggled with this a lot and still kinda do but honestly (and tbh this probably involves some ego stroking) the experience of getting positive feedback on work that u don't think is perfect helps minimize the anxiety and also learn from people who also have half-baked thoughts
@kate_qu oh yeah i forgot we're supposed to be trying to infiltrate the party or something
@kate_qu you make elections twitter sound arguably more toxic than left twitter lmao
@kate_qu all of the takes on whether or not the results mean Dems should move left or right to win more are half-baked and dumb but we can all agree that nancy pelosi sucks and should have gone away long ago
