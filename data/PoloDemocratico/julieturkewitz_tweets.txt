But when the pandemic hit, migrants around the world were among the first to lose jobs. Within wks, thousands of Venezuelans were trekking back to Venezuela, despite the hunger they knew awaited them. "Para pasar lo que esta pasando aqu√≠, prefiero estar en mi pa√≠s," Jessika said.
Jessika and her family are Venezuelan migrants who fled Venezuela before the pandemic, settling in Colombia. Their country has been in crisis since 2013, and they were among nearly two million migrants living in Colombia.

But in the days that followed the vote, something unexpected happened.
As Election Day neared, candidates fretted over the possibility of fraud. Voters across Bolivia questioned the solidity of the electoral process. And many worried that the result ‚Äî any result ‚Äî would provoke anger and violence from the other side.

But the vote in Bolivia shows that many Bolivians still believe firmly in Evo Morales's socialist movement. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go back to the time when we are suffering and others are winning,‚Äù said Luisa Alvarez, 40, a voter in the Morales stronghold of El Alto.
Mr. Morales has remained a contentious figure in Bolivia, both adored for his role in aiding the poor and criticized for holding on to power for too long.
Mr. Arce is the chosen successor of Mr. Morales, a transformative figure in a nation where power was traditionally concentrated in the hands of a wealthy, white elite.
Mr. Arce‚Äôs supporters began celebrating in the streets ‚Äî despite the fact that official results may not be available for days.
On Monday, exit polls in Bolivia showed Mr. Morales‚Äôs handpicked candidate, Luis Arce, with such a wide lead that his main opponent, Carlos Mesa, conceded the election.
THREAD: In a presidential election that was widely viewed as a referendum on the legacy of Evo Morales, Bolivia‚Äôs first Indigenous president, voters appear to have spoken clearly: They want his socialist project to go on. https://t.co/np5NN77r21
