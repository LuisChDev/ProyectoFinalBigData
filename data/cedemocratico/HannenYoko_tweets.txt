For the part of historians and the teller's readers.  Trumpcare made by wrongfully illegal immigration so selfish!  How can I forgiven themselves? They took all my payments, still the police department get me another fee 1500dollars  is completely fraudulent https://t.co/H41q76XXLV

@donwinslow Me too and I feel anger both. Cops are tense from Backhand, this recorded in public is worst Americans can separately really badly.Truth but  careless. In my son's case, he is innocent but Trump never show me his responsibility. American is worth really.
@adamkraymond This is really bad,  this case is bad people's guesses aren't necessarily worth. What's policy, who are protecting by the politics. I think there's no respectively for cops that are too tense only. Turkish airport security officers did to my innocent Leo too
@sharkey_g If he was belonged in prison just because he made my son hurt. For me his attitude is just wanker and coward. Used Veterans family in Japan and made them to Perkins family kept separate. Other government's sympathy saved Trump himself but no responsibility. https://t.co/G9c19AFrVC
