During the Great War, gold, which was the basis of the financial system, disappeared from circulation. Families and companies treasured it. #geusta
The gold standard was greatly favored by the fact that the country whose currency was the most important could distribute liquid debts to the rest of the world, without anyone having worried about their accumulation or even measuring them. #geusta
The international gold standard, system in which the value of each currency is defined by its content in gold, appeared around 1870 in Great Britain.
The international monetary system (SMI) is the organization of monetary relations between countries according to a set of rules, practices, infrastructures and institutions. #geusta
The gold standard, which worked until the world conflict, had an autonomous, mechanical, indomitable character, of the gold standard. #GEUSTA
Regional economic integration was conceived by ECLAC as a strategic line to break with the insufficient dynamism and low productivity of the Latin American economy (Tavares and Gomes, 1998). #geusta
regional economic integration, from the point of view of what is called classical theory, can have effects both on production and consumption and can be static and dynamic. #geusta
The effects on production and consumption that can generate the formation of a customs union, are called static effects, because the temporary element is not taken into account and also suppose the existence of perfect competition in goods and services. #geusta
According to the Vinerian theory, there is trade creation when a high-cost domestic producer is replaced by another member of the agreement, which is more efficient and produces at a lower cost. #geusta
Regional economic integration is considered by the classical school as an alternative to the liberalization of world trade. #geusta
If the polarization of regions and countries was fierce during the implementation of the CW, there has been no less polarization within the countries themselves, with huge masses of the population forced to submerge in informal and miserable economies. #geusta
Washington's plan,consisting of a world with open market economies &amp; substitutes for liberal democracies,has been successfully imposed.But beware,Williamson himself said that in the American continent"the CW is being executed in all the capitals of the hemisphere #geusta
The consensus is particularly directed at countries that have not deepened enough in capitalism, and was written thinking of those in Latin America. #geusta
The first formulation of the so-called "Washington consensus" is due to John Williamson. What Washington means when it refers to economic policy reforms, and was drafted in 1990. #geusta
The Bretton Woods agreements are the resolutions of the monetary and financial conference of the United Nations, held at the Bretton Woods hotel complex, between July 1 and 22, 1944. #geusta

The Monetary Fund project was approved in which the major powers, the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia and China, were assigned permanent representatives in the Executive Board of the institution. #geusta
Edward Brown, president of the First National Bank of Chicago, was the only private banker who attended as a delegate to the conference and that he participated actively in the work #geusta
The US government wanted the treaties to be discussed and approved within a peremptory period. #geusta
The increase in the incomes of entrepreneurs increases the price of consumer goods, decreasing the real wage. #Geusta
Fiscal policy is the tool that this model uses, to regulate the economy, thus generating a deficit. #Geusta
It is an economic doctrine that is based on the intervention of the State in the economy through an active expansive fiscal policy. #Geusta
Hayek maintained his faith in the virtues of the free market and his capacity for self-regulation. #Geusta
Keynes said that the state said that the state should intervene in case of crisis. #Geusta
Markets travel and keep what is done in other parts of the world. Thus, the countries that are more open to external trade are also what are most exposed to the ideas invented elsewhere in the world. 
#Geusta
The fact that ideas can be used by more than two people at the same time has a fundamental consequence in relation to the importance of trade.
#Geusta
There are two types of ingredients that are needed to produce goods and services (materials, work and ideas have a very important feature: they can be used by many people simultaneously.
#Geusta
One of the characteristics of ideas is that they accumulate. they do not appear by magic but rather they carry a procedure and these are pieces that produce ideas.
#Geusta
For the production of cookies material physical ingredients are needed, but human work is also needed. Economists call material ingredients (physical capital) and work (human capital).

It is important to consider that international consumption patterns penetrate Colombian society and that their production in the national territory does not satisfy them.
#Geusta
The opening allowed through international indebtedness, the tariff reduction, the smaller devaluations of the nominal exchange rate, expanded the consumption of imported goods to achieve in a more powerful way for those consumed
#Geusta
The domestic market lost importance in the national production and had export stagnation both in growth and in the composition of exports
#Geusta
Colombia had a big change in its economy in the 90s, and this caused a fall of relative participation in agriculture and manufacturing in the PIB
#Geusta
Companies try to take advantage of economies of scale by concentrating their production in one place, but when the costs of transportation are very high, you can even overcome benefits derived from agglomeration. #Geusta
During the Second World War it was observed that trade exhibited a different pattern, dominated by exchanges between developed countries, trade flows that were largely intraindustrial. #Geusta
the analyzes based on the shared advantages within the framework of markets that operate under perfect competition were recited and then formalized to have two productive factors: capital and labor. #Geusta
Krugman was important since his work gave rise to the snow theory of trade. #Geusta
To choose correctly, we must measure the benefits and the cost value of an activity. #Geusta
Due to scarcity we have to make choices since we can never have everything we want. #Geusta
The fundamental economic problem is the shortage that we face today. #Geusta
Economics is the science that studies how to meet the needs of people in an equitable way. #Geusta
In the world of economics you have to be prepared for some failures in business. #Geusta

Economic geography is a social science that studies market conditions according to the geographic distribution of producers and consumers
#Geusta
Macroeconomics focuses on large-scale economic systems, such as that of a country or region.
#Geusta
Microeconomics is the branch of the economy that studies the behavior, actions and decisions of individual economic agents, such as individuals, families or companies, and their relations and interaction in the markets.

The economy is a social science that studies the processes of extraction, production, exchange, distribution and consumption of goods and services.
