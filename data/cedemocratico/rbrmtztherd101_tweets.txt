@HillaryClinton He's unhinged.
The fight to win #JusticeforFloyd is still not over. We must hold the DA accountable to arrest and charge ALL three officers with murder. 

@HennepinAtty, there are still 3 murderers roaming free. Arrest and charge them now! Text 'FLOYD' to 55156.

Oh and watching another bully but not taking action? It's called bystander bullying

@PressSec You should hang your head in shame for accepting this position to defend this monster of a man. Whoever put the young lady in charge of taking a reporter's microphone should be fired with the whole lot of you. This is a dictatorship, not a democracy

Good on Marc Anthony. This is about the disrespect of 45 shown to the people of PR. Our president is a reality show hack, knows nothing about how to run this country, stokes fear and division, is offensive and denigrates people. His behavior toward Puerto Rico is horrible. https://t.co/fD1QhawzCj

@chrissyteigen Let's be obsessive and get out the vote!
@_xoxo_G @chrissyteigen So it's alright for Trump to use his platform to implement  disrespectful public policy based on his whim driven personal opinions, but not Chrissy Teigen to speak her personal views??? From which privileged planet are you broadcasting?
@realDonaldTrump As for your thoughts and prayers, "I really don't care, do u?"
@NBCNews How to be respectful of public servants who speak so disparagingly of their citizens? @JeffSessions_  you're so unfit for the task
@realDonaldTrump You lack everything it takes to be a real ambassador, leader of our once proud nation. You have reduced the national dialogue to trash talk. You're an evil mean spirited bully. Go away.
@madamski56 @HillaryClinton @madamski56 Didn't you hear that Flotus is focused on cyberbullying?

@morningmika WCHA dinner is about celebrating freedom of speech. Why as a journalist aren't you supporting this? Trump exercises this right recklessly, dangerously, unprofessionally, daily. Michelle Wolf hit where it hurts. Truth is painful. Good on her!
@Maleficus24 @Mike_cdko @davidhogg111 You volunteered for service. It was not about defending the constitution, rather it was about oil &amp; power. Why compromise your record as a soldier by name calling a victim of a school shooting? Work on a solution rather than antagonizing a student.

@fireangel2091 @sandyrn224 @AlBirks @realDonaldTrump Wow, I can understand why you like # 45. Your spelling and grammar is just like his. Almost  $54,000,000 in costs for his golf outings. Ignorance is bliss, isn't it?
@fireangel2091 @sandyrn224 @AlBirks @realDonaldTrump Yes, your peaceful pussy grabber is going to save you, bring back coal, build a wall, take you back to the great ol' days-after charging the gov't &amp; us all for lavish trips to his golf resorts to collude w/corrupt countries to line his pockets. Don't worry he'll take care of you
@fireangel2091 @sandyrn224 @AlBirks @realDonaldTrump More lies and falsehoods from the irrational right
@fireangel2091 @sandyrn224 @AlBirks @realDonaldTrump So it's ok for a corrupt business man, who built his empire on others' backs/turned politician to be sexist, but not a politician? Not buying your distortion/double standards.  Trumpers love making their own rules &amp; history.
@fireangel2091 @sandyrn224 @AlBirks @realDonaldTrump Exactly-Wasn't right 55 years ago. So why haven't you learned that? Why are you yawning instead of doing something about it? Yawn yawn? Wake up!
@RepMarkMcGovern @realDonaldTrump Change begins with not supporting a person who stokes division. To support Donald and advocate for peace &amp; unity is hypocrisy.
@fireangel2091 @sandyrn224 @AlBirks @realDonaldTrump Supporting the pussy grabber. So smart. It's 2018. Ladies, it's time to stand for yourselves-riding the coattails of a misogynistic male is out.
@ThomasJosephMil @JackieSharp @realDonaldTrump AR 15s involved in SO many of these shootings. What'll it take for you to care? Banning this gun is a start toward fixing a complex problem. By the way, more guns aren't the answer. 291 shootings since 2013, 18 in 2018. Get real.  How would you feel if this hit home?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Donald, if you want to be the president you say you are, then do something to stem the shootings in our schools. BAN assault weapons, improve our mental health services. Doing nothing is complicity. 291 since 2013
@RepMarkMcGovern @realDonaldTrump It has to do with the tenor of rhetoric set by #45. Kinda like they way GOP treated Obama, remember.? It's called eye for an eye. He doesn't get to be the only one disrespecting others.
