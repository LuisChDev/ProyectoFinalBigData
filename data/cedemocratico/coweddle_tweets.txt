...y no que los n√∫meros se hayan oficializado o que un ente gubernamental haya declarado el ganador.  La idea para los medios es ser el primero en prever un ganador en cada estado, sin equivocarse jam√°s.
Los grandes medios tienen grupos de estad√≠sticos que est√°n analizando los resultados que van publicando los estados poco a poco. Cuando dicen que preven que un candidato ha ganado un estado, quiere decir que esos equipos han determinado que la tendencia es irreversible...
@MariBastardo de nada!
El candidato que llega a 270 votos electorales es el ganador. 

Y listo. No es tan complicado.
California, donde vive mucha gente, tiene 55 votos, mientras Wyoming, donde vive poca gente, tiene tres.  El candidato que gane hoy en California en el voto popular, aunque sea por un voto, gana los 55 votos del estado.
Creo que muchas de estas explicaciones complejas y largas del Colegio Electoral est√°n confundiendo a√∫n m√°s.

Cada estado tiene una cantidad de votos electorales que es proporcional al tama√±o de su poblaci√≥n.
