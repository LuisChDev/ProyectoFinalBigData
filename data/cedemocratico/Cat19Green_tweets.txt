To be honest, DEMs need to make sure they maintain the Governorship in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin as well as the row offices because I guarantee you that the GOP will try to rig things for their nominee(especially if it's Trump) if things are close there in 2024.

@Alex4BlueFL @stephenhjohnson @senpizzo @FlaDems Yeah and that's proof that it's more complicated than saying Gillum swept her up. I think she won in an under the radar manner.
@Alex4BlueFL @stephenhjohnson @senpizzo @FlaDems But Nelson, Shaw, and Ring didn't win with him on the ticket.
@stephenhjohnson @Alex4BlueFL @senpizzo @FlaDems I think he's referring to your reference about a state income tax above which wasn't what Gillum was proposing and anyway that isn't possible because it's written in Florida's constitution. Not calling you a liar here though, looks like a mistake.
@Alex4BlueFL @stephenhjohnson @senpizzo @FlaDems Well, the Senate race had higher turnout than the Governor's race did and Nelson lost his race by 22,430 votes less than Gillum did and you could argue that the Broward ballot design is what cost him those 10,033 votes.
@Alex4BlueFL @stephenhjohnson @senpizzo @FlaDems Then why didn't Gillum carry Sean Shaw or Jeremy Ring over the finish line? Why didn't Gillum carry Nelson over the finish line?

@Alex4BlueFL Gillum's progressive platform and endorsement by Bernie Sanders was fodder for the GOP to paint him as a radical socialist, same with him dodging the question of him being a socialist. Tons of Latino voters voted against Gillum because of this.
@Alex4BlueFL Hispanic voters and black voters don't necessarily want progressive policy as a whole like I've heard from one Latino and one black person that they don't want to defund the police.
@CharlieNJ @senpizzo Socialism has been tied to cancel culture by the GOP as  countries with far left dictatorships and communist nations  censor people's speech/artistic expression. It's not just economic stuff it's tied to.
@DohukyMd3 @ArePundits Wrong there. Bill Nelson and Alex Sink won in 2006, Obama won in 2008, Obama and Bill Nelson won in 2012, and Nikki Fried won in 2018. And Trump won Florida by less than Bush did that year, 3.3 instead of 5.1.
@CharlieNJ @senpizzo I've talked to several Republicans there- they think that the Democrats want to destroy traditional values and turn the country into a socialist country. What do you hear from them about their reasoning for voting Republican?
@DohukyMd3 @ArePundits Osceola's demographics weren't the same as back then though.
