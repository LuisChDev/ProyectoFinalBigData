RVP just missed a sitter! #noyawa though
I can agree with this line up.  Expect Rooney and RVP to be subbed when we get our goals to rest them for Wed. #ManUtd #Not1Nil
A win today and the title is ours #ManUtd #itwonthappenagain @OvieO @FOXSoccer
United to go 12 point clear! #ManUtd

‚Äú@FOXSoccerTrax: This will be regarded as an upset, but on the balance of play, Nigeria earned it with a very fine performance‚Äù&gt; not really.
A disorganized, unimpressive, selfish, undisciplined super eagles team knocks out Ivory Coast.  Imagine the possibilities! @OvieO
