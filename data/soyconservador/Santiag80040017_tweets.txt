@sergiov49216496 @GeroMeme202 i am agree with you, we have put our trust on the media as an authority to give us news, entertainment and education. However, the influence of mass media on our kids, teenagers and society is so big that we should know how it really works.
@GeroMeme202 I think that the mass media means technology aimed at reaching a mass audience, as we have seen for many years, the public or the audience often trust the mass media to provide information on political, social, entertainment and pop culture news.
