A mi me dejó traumatizado la película Tiburón. Hasta ir a piscina era una experiencia bastante aterradora. https://t.co/1QvAQpeuE1
@claychristensen I am sad. I know him through his theories, articles and books. It gave me hope about my future. Thanks for all you gave to the world. I always remember you. He was a hero to me. My deepest condolences to his family.
