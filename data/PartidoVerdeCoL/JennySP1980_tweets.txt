@tjwmurphy @KittyKatCassy @theMediaChick @andreagibson Not really dodgy, there have been barely any incidences of voters committing fraud by using someone else's name, and insisting on ID when the only available official IDs in the UK are fairly pricey is a form of voter suppression.

@tpcfi @Valleyme @franciscarockey Well you seem to think that the last Labour government should have managed to solve all the problems created by the previous 18 years of Tory rule in the 13 years they were in power.
@tpcfi @Valleyme @franciscarockey And if it were so terrible under the last Labour government then how come a decade later the wonderful amazing Tories haven't magically fixed everything?
@tpcfi @Valleyme @franciscarockey Under the last Labour gov local councils had more funding, the deficit was lower and sure start centres supported families that needed it. Then the banks collapsed. The deficit was still lower after bail out than currently. Tell me again how things better now than under Labour?

@amadobson @IanDunt Yep, it's disgusting how Labour support those fighting against racism. I mean obviously they should defend those who made their fortunes from slavery at all costs.
@ArchConway @stevesitmail @IanDunt https://t.co/cnq3TsD5Qc
@kirstymcnally @IanDunt They've been wanting to rename the hall for years? Much like with the Colston statue, which has been the target of several petitions and has been defaced multiple times in the time I have lived in Bristol, this isn't new, it's an ongoing battle.
@CornockStehen @MartinDaubney @piersmorgan @GMB There has never been an official vote. Why did there need to be? Are you honestly trying to defend the rights of a statue of a mass murderer?
@stephenkeane233 @MartinDaubney @piersmorgan @GMB It's one statue, of a mass murderer. No slippery slope. No violence in Bristol, no other property damaged. Why are you trying to defend keeping up the statue of a mass murderer?
@JohnWootton6 @MartinDaubney @piersmorgan @GMB Nope. A local newspaper commissioned a poll into whether we should change the name of Colston Hall, which showed a marginal preference for keeping the name.

@custardcross @xandvt The statue of Colston in Bristol was a bit like having a statue of Franco in Madrid with an inscription reading "He brought the country together". It represented Colston as a philanthropist rather than someone with no regard for human suffering.
@custardcross @xandvt The statue had to go, it should have been taken down years ago. The council didn't even manage changing the words on the plaque to be more accurate due to the interference by the Merchant Venturers, many of whose families made their fortunes from the slave trade.
@AletaMorgan @Paramedic_Sky @lemonsneaky @tezilyas I've lived in Bristol for 20 years, I've signed loads of petitions to get Colston's statue removed. It wasn't going to be removed by legal means. I'm glad it's gone. It should be replaced with a memorial to the thousands he stole from their homes.
